# Bayesian Statistics 

We used bayesian statistics methods with a view to __predicting equity market's mouvement__. During the backtest (on the _S&P 500_ index), we obtained a performance of +1.83% on a 10 days period. 


This repository hosts the project for the Bayesian Statistics course at ENSAE, made by Nathan BRY & Bertrand VUILLEMOT. It contains : 
* The report describing the rationale of the bayesian model and the results of backtest : _Report.pdf_
* The notebook containing the code concerning the implementation of both the model and the backtest : _Final_StatsBay.ipynb_
